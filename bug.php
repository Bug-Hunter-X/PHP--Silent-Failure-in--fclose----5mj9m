```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```

This code is vulnerable to a common error: it doesn't check the return value of `fclose()`.  While it's less common to explicitly check for errors from `fclose()`, failing to do so means you'll silently ignore potential errors related to closing the file.  This might not immediately cause an issue, but under high load or with resource constraints, it can lead to resource leaks (file handles not properly released) and unpredictable behavior.
